Mass market type of product:
(For averager consumer, targetting consumers directly)

Enterprise Integration Platforms:
Offer consultancy or software platforms that help businesses integrate AI agents into their existing workflows—connecting CRMs, ERP systems, ticketing software, and other business tools. This could be a “turnkey” solution that lets non-technical companies adopt AI agents seamlessly.

Industry-Specific AI Agents:
Develop specialized agents fine-tuned for particular verticals. For example:

Healthcare: Agents that help with medical coding, patient intake, billing disputes, and compliance documentation.

Legal: Agents that can perform case law research, draft standard legal documents, and assist paralegals in sifting through discovery materials.
Logistics: Agents that automatically negotiate shipping rates, manage inventory orders, or schedule freight deliveries.

AI Workforce Augmentation Services:
Market services that combine human expertise with AI agents. Instead of selling a product, sell a managed service: a team of human analysts supported by industry-tuned AI agents to handle tasks like data cleaning, lead generation, or compliance checking, thereby offering consistently high output at lower costs.

Agent Monitoring & Compliance Tools:
As companies adopt AI agents, they’ll need oversight to ensure accuracy, security, and regulatory compliance. Launch a tool that monitors agent decisions, flags anomalies, and provides audit trails. This would appeal to businesses worried about data misuse or incorrect outputs.

Training & Onboarding Solutions for AI Agents:
Just like employees, AI agents need proper setup and training. A company could specialize in “agent onboarding”—configuring domain-specific knowledge bases, establishing appropriate prompts, and maintaining performance over time. This service ensures that any off-the-shelf AI agent becomes domain- and brand-savvy for the client.

Agent-to-Agent Marketplaces:
Imagine a digital marketplace where companies can browse, rent, and integrate specialized AI agents for particular tasks—like an “App Store” for AI agents. This platform could vet quality, handle billing, and update agents automatically, attracting both developers (to list their agents) and enterprises (to quickly find the right agent for their needs).

Workflow & Productivity Suites with Embedded AI Agents:
Build new productivity tools (like project management software, note-taking apps, or calendar assistants) that have AI agents natively integrated. These agents can summarize meetings, create to-do lists from transcripts, or automatically draft follow-up emails, turning traditional tools into “intelligent” productivity hubs.
