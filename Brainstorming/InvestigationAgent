I want to build an AI-driven investigation application to assist cybersecurity agents in efficiently handling security incidents and threat hunting. The application will:

Document-Based Workflow:

Open an investigation document where the cybersecurity agent can input IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) and natural language descriptions of the incident or threat-hunting goals.
Follow a predefined schema for the document:
Background: Context of the investigation.
IOCs: Indicators such as IP addresses, hashes, domains, etc.
Threat Intel: Supporting intelligence related to the investigation.
Log Sources: A table of different log sources to query (e.g., ElasticSearch, SentinelOne, Symantec EDR).
AI Query Generation and Execution:

Use an AI agent to:
Automatically generate and fine-tune queries (ElasticSearch queries, SentinelOne queries, Symantec EDR queries, etc.) based on the input IOCs and context.
Validate and troubleshoot these queries, fixing errors dynamically.
Execute the queries against various log sources via their APIs.
Log Analysis and Insights:

Retrieve log data from the queried sources, interpret the results, and categorize findings. This includes:
Identifying log source, executed query, and key events found.
Analyzing patterns, anomalies, or correlations in the logs.
Automatically populate the investigation table in the document with:
Log source queried.
Query executed.
Summary of events found.
Detailed analysis and contextual notes.
Intelligent Reporting:

Generate a professional, comprehensive report at the end of the investigation:
Include a summary of findings.
Provide recommendations for mitigation or further investigation steps.
Customizable Schema and API Integrations:

Allow agents to define and customize the schema of the investigation document based on organizational needs.
Provide integration templates for common log sources and EDR tools, but also allow custom API configurations for proprietary tools.
Collaboration Features:

Enable collaborative editing of investigation documents, so multiple analysts can contribute simultaneously.
Track changes and maintain a history of edits for audit purposes.
Visualization and Data Enrichment:

Offer visual dashboards to represent data from the logs, such as timelines of events, heatmaps of anomalies, and network activity graphs.
Enrich data using external threat intelligence sources, adding more context to the investigation.
Integration with Existing Tooling:

Provide export options for investigation data to popular SIEMs, SOAR platforms, or ticketing systems.
Enable webhook notifications for critical findings.
Secure and Scalable Architecture:

Ensure the application is built with robust security measures to protect sensitive data.
Design the system to handle large-scale log queries and data efficiently.
Learning and Continuous Improvement:

Implement a feedback loop where the AI agent learns from user feedback on the accuracy of queries and interpretations, improving over time.
Provide a sandbox mode for testing new queries without affecting production systems.
