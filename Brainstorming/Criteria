Below is a streamlined table combining the main criteria and key “quick-check” questions. You can use this table to quickly assess any idea for a small-scale cybersecurity POC leveraging AI/LLMs. Feel free to add scoring columns (e.g., 1–5) or “Pass/Fail” checkboxes as needed.

How to Use It

1. List your ideas in one column (rows).


2. Evaluate each idea against each criterion above.


3. Score or mark pass/fail for each (optional).


4. Compare total results to decide which idea(s) are most viable for a two-person POC in the cybersecurity + AI/LLM space.







When thinking about a small-yet-impactful cybersecurity product that leverages AI or large language models (LLMs), it helps to have a clear set of criteria to systematically assess whether it’s worth pursuing. Below are some key areas and questions to guide your evaluation:


---

1. Problem Definition & Market Need

Pain Point Clarity: Is there a clear and pressing security problem you’re solving? Can you articulate it in a sentence or two?

Market Segment Focus: Who specifically needs this solution (e.g., SMBs, enterprise, developers, cloud providers)? Does the pain point resonate strongly with them?

Competitive Landscape: Are there existing solutions in the market? If so, how is your approach uniquely leveraging AI or LLMs to provide differentiation?


Why it matters: A well-defined, real-world problem where standard solutions fall short or are too slow/expensive is more likely to attract early customers or interest from acquirers.


---

2. Technical Feasibility & Resource Constraints

Technical Complexity: Given that you’re a small team (two people), can you realistically build a functional proof-of-concept without requiring extensive specialized infrastructure or additional hires?

Data Availability: Do you have (or can you obtain) the necessary data for training and testing an AI/LLM-based solution? Do you need proprietary data or can you rely on publicly available datasets?

Breadth vs. Depth: Aim for a well-defined, relatively narrow use case. Smaller, more focused solutions are more feasible to build and prove out with limited resources.


Why it matters: You want to ensure the idea doesn’t become too large or resource-intensive to handle as a two-person team in the POC stage.


---

3. Ability to Demonstrate Quick Value (POC / POV)

Minimal Viable Functionality: What is the smallest possible feature set you can build to demonstrate tangible results (e.g., detecting a specific type of threat, automating a particular security analysis task)?

Proof of Concept Scope: Can you craft a short, compelling demo showing how AI/LLMs solve a problem faster or more accurately than manual or rule-based methods?

Customer or Stakeholder Buy-In: Could you pilot the solution with a small group of real users (possibly friendly beta testers or a small paying customer) to gather feedback and validate your approach?


Why it matters: Early validation and tangible results greatly improve the chances of generating revenue or attracting acquirers.


---

4. Uniqueness & Differentiation

Innovation Factor: How does using AI or LLMs meaningfully improve cybersecurity outcomes (e.g., faster triaging, automated reporting, advanced anomaly detection)?

Defensible Moat: Is there something in your approach—like a proprietary model, special training data, or AI-based workflow—that can’t be easily replicated by others?

Speed to Market: If you do have a unique or innovative angle, can you bring it to market quickly enough to maintain a competitive edge?


Why it matters: In a crowded cybersecurity landscape, having a defensible differentiator—especially around AI and automation—can set you apart.


---

5. Revenue & Monetization Potential

Pricing Model: Can the product be priced and sold easily (e.g., a SaaS subscription, a one-time license, or pay-per-use)?

Market Size & Willingness to Pay: Even if the initial market is small, do you see a clear path to grow? How pain-driven is the problem, and how big are the budgets typically allocated?

Scaling / Exit Strategy: If the goal is to sell or be acquired, does your technology or product fit into a larger cybersecurity stack that a larger player might want to integrate?


Why it matters: Even for a small POC, having a potential revenue model or a compelling fit with larger platforms makes it easier to attract interest and/or funding.


---

6. Regulatory & Compliance Considerations

Data Privacy & Security: How are you handling potentially sensitive data, especially if you’re training or fine-tuning an LLM with client data? Are you aligning with relevant standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)?

Industry-Specific Requirements: If you target regulated industries (finance, healthcare), do you address any compliance frameworks (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA)?

Ethical & Responsible AI: Are you mitigating risks such as model hallucinations or bias, which can be critical in cybersecurity contexts?


Why it matters: Ensuring compliance and addressing ethical implications can be a deal-maker or -breaker in the security domain.


---

7. Go-to-Market & Customer Validation

Pilot or Beta Users: Do you have potential early adopters (friends, professional contacts) who can try the POC and give actionable feedback?

Sales/Marketing Motion: How would you reach potential customers beyond your immediate network? Could you leverage marketplaces, partnerships, or developer communities?

Adoption vs. Complexity: Will users need extensive training to use the product effectively, or is it intuitive enough to self-onboard?


Why it matters: Early market traction (even on a small scale) is often what impresses investors or acquirers—the ability to show that real users are willing to use (and pay for) your solution.


---

8. Scalability & Future Roadmap

Technical Scalability: If you gain traction, will the architecture support rapid scaling or expansions of features?

Roadmap Clarity: Once the POC is proven, do you have ideas on how to expand functionality, integrate with other tools, or open new use cases?

Potential for Partnership or Acquisition: Which companies or platforms might you partner with to accelerate adoption? How does your solution fit into a broader product ecosystem?


Why it matters: Even a small POC should have a longer-term vision. Demonstrating that you have a path to scale (or to exit) helps with investor or partner confidence.


---

Putting It All Together

A concise cybersecurity POC that effectively leverages AI/LLMs should:

1. Tackle a well-defined, pressing security issue where AI or LLMs provide a distinct advantage.


2. Focus on minimal, high-impact functionality to show clear, measurable results with limited effort.


3. Provide demonstrable value quickly, ideally via a short pilot or beta program with real users.


4. Outline a clear monetization or exit path, ensuring the project can be sustained or sold.



With these criteria in mind, you can more confidently move forward with an idea that’s both feasible to execute as a small team and appealing enough to generate returns or attract acquirers.
