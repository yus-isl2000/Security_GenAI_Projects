Let's make an html webpage that will a the main webpage to for my Ai assistant. First here will be a box that represent the state of my emails and calendar to see the most up to date vision of anything important there. Then there will be a box for todo: today, near,medium and long term. Then there will be a box for current investigations, and another one for threat hunts. For each box there will be a button that will allow me to kick start the agent or refresh the status or engage it. The idea is that each agent is continuous looping and doing work on my behalf, one check calendar and email to notify and summarize important information, one to have a working memory of items in flight, one that is investigation a cyber case and doing queries and fillling a report on my behalf, one that is doing hunts so threat intel and then querying on logs based on that. There will finally be an threat intel box where we have a research agent that keeps with each hot topic. Each agent will have gaps in its workflow, so there will be also an agent working to fill in gaps. This last agent is going to need input from the user. All of this is going to be powered by a local python backend webserver where the python code for each agent will be. Make it modular so that each box in the front end is equivalent to one python agent in the backend. There will be some programming involved in python3 to connect for example to outlook, calendar, browsing for threat intel, etc... but most of the analysis work is going to be large language model based through the gemini API.
