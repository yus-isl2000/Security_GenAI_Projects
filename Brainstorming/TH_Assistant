Structured Specification Prompt for AI Assistant Webpage
Objective
To design and implement a modular AI assistant webpage and backend to support a set of autonomous agents. Each agent will perform a specific function related to email, calendar, task management, threat intelligence, investigations, and cyber threat hunting. The system will allow user interaction and live updates through a centralized dashboard.

Front-End Webpage Design
Overview of the Webpage Structure

Email and Calendar Module:

Displays the latest important emails and calendar events.
Summarizes critical items using an AI agent.
Includes buttons for:
Kick-start the agent.
Refresh the status.
Engage with the agent for input.
To-Do List Module:

Organized into four categories:
Today.
Near-term.
Medium-term.
Long-term.
Includes buttons for:
Kick-start the agent.
Refresh the status.
Engage with the agent for input.
Current Investigations Module:

Displays details of ongoing investigations.
Uses an agent to:
Perform queries.
Generate reports.
Track investigation progress.
Includes buttons for:
Kick-start the agent.
Refresh the status.
Engage with the agent for input.
Threat Hunts Module:

Shows active threat hunts and their progress.
Powered by an agent that:
Monitors threat intelligence feeds.
Queries logs to identify anomalies.
Includes buttons for:
Kick-start the agent.
Refresh the status.
Engage with the agent for input.
Threat Intel Research Module:

Displays summaries of trending topics in cyber threat intelligence.
Managed by an agent that continuously browses for hot topics and provides updates.
Includes buttons for:
Kick-start the agent.
Refresh the status.
Engage with the agent for input.
Gap-Filling Agent Module:

Highlights areas where other agents require user input.
Allows the user to fill gaps manually.
Includes buttons for:
Kick-start the agent.
Refresh the status.
Engage with the agent for input.
Modular Approach

Each front-end box corresponds to a single Python agent on the backend.
The layout is clean, with dynamic updates reflecting the status of the agents.
Modular design ensures new modules/agents can be easily added.
Back-End Implementation Plan
Python Web Server

Framework: Use Flask or FastAPI to serve the front-end and handle agent APIs.
Core Features:
Define endpoints for each agent.
Handle incoming requests to kick-start, refresh, or engage with agents.
Serve static content (HTML, CSS, JS) for the webpage.
Agent Logic

General Structure:

Each agent will be a Python class/module with specific capabilities.
Use the Gemini API for analysis tasks requiring large language models.
Agent-Specific Tasks:

Email and Calendar Agent:
Connect to Outlook API to retrieve emails and calendar events.
Use the Gemini API to summarize important items.
To-Do Agent:
Maintain a database (e.g., SQLite) for categorized tasks.
Track task progress and provide updates.
Investigation Agent:
Integrate with log querying systems and report generation tools.
Automate repetitive investigation tasks.
Threat Hunt Agent:
Leverage threat intelligence APIs and log management systems.
Perform anomaly detection and generate insights.
Threat Intel Research Agent:
Continuously browse and summarize trending topics in cyber threat intelligence.
Gap-Filling Agent:
Monitor gaps in workflows and request user input as needed.
Communication Protocol

Use REST APIs to facilitate communication between the front-end and the backend.
Define endpoints for each agent to support:
Start/stop operations.
Refresh status.
Handle user input.
Database Requirements

Use a lightweight database (SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store:
Task lists and their statuses.
Investigation logs.
Threat intelligence summaries.
User inputs.
Authentication and Security

Use API keys or OAuth for authentication when integrating with external services (e.g., Outlook).
Ensure secure communication using HTTPS.
Agent Workflow

Design agents to continuously loop and perform their tasks.
Use scheduling libraries like APScheduler to manage periodic operations.
Development Plan
Phase 1: Front-End Design

Create a responsive HTML webpage with placeholder modules for each agent.
Implement modular CSS for styling.
Phase 2: Back-End Integration

Set up the Python web server with REST APIs for communication.
Build stubs for each agent.
Phase 3: Agent Implementation

Develop and connect agents to their respective modules.
Integrate external APIs (e.g., Outlook, threat intelligence feeds).
Phase 4: Testing

Test individual modules for functionality.
Perform end-to-end testing to ensure seamless integration.
Phase 5: Deployment

Deploy the system locally.
Plan for scaling to cloud hosting if required.
Review Questions
Completeness:

Are all required modules and agents defined?
Have we accounted for both agent-specific tasks and their gaps?
Clarity:

Is the modular design clear enough to support easy addition of new agents or features?
Integration:

Have we addressed all external system integrations (e.g., Outlook, threat intel APIs)?
User Experience:

Does the front-end design meet usability needs for live updates and user input?
Scalability:

Will this architecture support additional agents or modules as required?
